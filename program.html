      <h4>A Programming Language Characterizing Quantum Polynomial Time</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We introduce a first-order quantum programming language, named FOQ, whose
      terminating programs are reversible.  We restrict FOQ to a strict and
      tractable subset, named PFOQ, of terminating programs with bounded width,
      that provides a first programming-language-based characterization of the
      quantum complexity class FBQP. We finally present a tractable
      semantics-preserving algorithm compiling a PFOQ program to a quantum
      circuit of size polynomial in the number of input qubits.

      <h4>The Mobius game and other Bell test for relativity</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We derive multiparty games that, if the winning chance exceeds a certain limit, prove the incompatibility of the
      parties' causal relations with any partial order. This, in turn, means that the parties exert a back-action on
      the causal relations; the causal relations are dynamical. The games turn out to be representable by directed
      graphs, for instance by an orientation of the Möbius ladder. We discuss these games as device-independent tests
      of spacetime's dynamical nature in general relativity. To do so, we design a relativistic setting where, in the
      Minkowski spacetime, the winning chance is bound to the limits. In contrast, we find otherwise tame processes
      with classical control of causal order that win the games deterministically. These suggest a violation of the
      bounds in gravitational implementations. We obtain these games by uncovering a "pairwise central symmetry" of
      the correlations in question. This symmetry allows us to recycle the facets of the acyclic subgraph polytope
      studied by Grötschel, Jünger, and Reinelt in the mid-80s for combinatorial optimization. In addition, we derive
      multiparty games in a scenario where the polytope dimension grows only linearly in the number of parties. Here,
      exceeding the limits not only proves the dynamical nature of the causal relations, but also that the
      correlations are incompatible with any global causal order.

      <h4>Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in various forms:
      information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to the flow of information, and the latter to the
      structure of spacetime. Leveraging a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects
      these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here, information-theoretic causality
      is defined through a causal modelling approach, which enables the inference of causal connections through
      agents' interventions and correlations. First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic
      signalling as defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide conditions for identifying
      redundancies in different parts of such a relation, introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful
      causal models (where the observable data does not “faithfully” reflect the causal dependences). In particular,
      this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the absence of signalling between certain nodes.
      Second, we define an order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for light cones in
      Minkowski space-times with d &gt; 1 spatial dimensions but violated for d = 1. Finally, we study the embedding
      of information-theoretic causal models in spacetime without violating relativistic principles such as no
      superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed by NSS in a spacetime and those
      imposed by purely information-theoretic causal inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence
      between conical space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel between these
      two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between informational and geometric notions of causality,
      and offers new insights and tools for studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops
      in different spacetime geometries and theories of information processing.

      <h4>Topological Quantum Programming via Linear Homotopy Types</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We explain that there is a closer relation between Quantum Computing and Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) than might
      superficially be expected. <br>
      First, we observe that the specification of topological quantum gates based on anyon braiding is essentially
      a native construct in HoTT, being given by type transport in the 0-truncation of a certain dependent function
      type into dependent Eilenberg MacLane types. This follows by a neat synthetic encoding of “Gauss-Manin
      connections” into HoTT, combined with a theorem by Feigin, Schechtmann &amp; Varchenko (1991) on conformal
      quantum field theory. Arguably, this reveals (certified) topological quantum computing as the first use-case of
      genuinely “homotopical computation”.
      <br>
      Moreover, we observe that HoTT admits conservative extensions by dependent linear homotopy types (LHoTT)
      which constitute genuine quantum data types much as familiar from the Quipper quantum programming language.
      Semantically this reflects the remarkable observation by Biedermann et al. that ∞-categories of parameterized
      module spectra (interpreting dependent linear homotopy types) are ∞-toposes. Specifically, LHoTT verifies the
      Grothendieck-Wirthmüller “motivic yoga of operations” on parameterized spectra, and we observe that this implies
      admissible inference rules for whole a system of (co)monads on linear homotopy types which naturally express
      quantum effects both on pure as well as on mixed states. In particular this recovers (hence certifies) Coecke et
      al.'s quantum measurement monads now used in the zx-Caclulus, and it provides “dynamic lifting” of measurement
      results as envisioned by the Quipper community.

      <h4>CP-infinity and beyond: 2-categorical dilation theory</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The problem of extending the insights and techniques of categorical quantum mechanics to infinite-dimensional
      systems was considered in (Coecke and Heunen, 2016 - In Proceedings QPL 2011). In that work the CP-infinity
      construction, which recovers the category of Hilbert spaces and quantum operations from the category of Hilbert
      spaces and bounded linear maps, was defined. Here we show that by a 'horizontal categorification' of the
      CP&infin;-construction, one can recover the category of all von Neumann algebras and channels (normal unital
      completely positive maps) from the 2-category [W*] of von Neumann algebras, bimodules and intertwiners. As an
      application, we extend Choi's characterisation of extremal channels between finite-dimensional matrix algebras
      to a characterisation of extremal channels between arbitrary von Neumann algebras.

      <h4>Lifting noncontextuality inequalities</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Kochen-Specker contextuality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for quantum
      computational advantage and reduction of communication complexity. Its presence is witnessed in empirical data
      by the violation of noncontextuality inequalities. However, all known noncontextuality inequalities
      corresponding to facets of noncontextual polytopes are either Bell inequalities or refer to cyclic or
      state-independent contextuality scenarios. <br>

      We introduce a general method for lifting noncontextuality inequalities, deriving facets of noncontextual
      polytopes for more complex scenarios from known facets of simpler sub-scenarios. Concretely, starting from an
      arbitrary scenario, the addition of a new measurement or a new outcome preserves the facet-defining nature of
      any noncontextuality inequality. This extends the results of Pironio [J. Math. Phys. 46, 062112 (2005)] from
      Bell nonlocality scenarios to contextuality scenarios and unifies liftings of Bell and noncontextuality
      inequalities. We show that our method produces facet-defining noncontextuality inequalities in all scenarios
      with contextual correlations, and we present examples of facet-defining noncontextuality inequalities for
      scenarios where no examples were known. <br>

      Our results shed light on the structure of noncontextuality polytopes and the relationship between such
      polytopes across different scenarios.

      <h4>Optimal protocols for universal adjointation of isometry operations</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Identification of possible transformations of quantum objects including quantum states and quantum operations is
      indispensable in developing quantum algorithms. <br>

      Universal transformations, defined as input-independent transformations, appear in various quantum applications.
      Such is the case for universal transformations of unitary operations. However, extending these transformations
      to non-unitary operations is nontrivial and largely unresolved. Addressing this, we introduce isometry
      adjointation protocols that convert an input isometry operation into its adjoint operation, which include both
      unitary operation and quantum state transformations. The paper details the construction of parallel and
      sequential isometry adjointation protocols, derived from unitary inversion protocols using quantum combs, and
      achieving optimal approximation error. This error is shown to be independent of the output dimension of the
      isometry operation. In particular, we explicitly obtain an asymptotically optimal parallel protocol achieving an
      approximation error &epsi; = &theta;(d<sup>2/n</sup>), where d is the input dimension of the isometry operation
      and n is the number of calls of the isometry operation.

      <h4>Optimal compilation of parametrised quantum circuits</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Parametrised quantum circuits contain phase gates whose phase is determined by a classical algorithm prior to
      running the circuit on a quantum device. Such circuits are used in variational algorithms like QAOA and VQE. In
      order for these algorithms to be as efficient as possible it is important that we use the fewest number of
      parameters. We show that, while the general problem of minimising the number of parameters is NP-hard, when we
      restrict to circuits that are Clifford apart from parametrised phase gates and where each parameter is used just
      once, we <em>can</em> efficiently find the optimal parameter count. We show that when parameter transformations
      are required to be sufficiently well-behaved that the only rewrites that reduce parameters correspond to simple
      'fusions'. Using this we find that a previous circuit optimisation strategy by some of the authors [Kissinger,
      van de Wetering. PRA (2019)] finds the optimal number of parameters.<br>

      Our proof uses the ZX-calculus. We also prove that the standard rewrite rules of the ZX-calculus suffice to
      prove any equality between parametrised Clifford circuits.

      <h4>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem
	and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Error and disturbance are fundamental concepts in quantum measurements. Here we show that these two concepts can
      be formulated as special cases of irreversibility of quantum processes. Our formulation provides fruitful
      byproducts: First, we unify the existing formulations of error and disturbance and derive them from ours by
      constructing the corresponding quantum processes. Second, we extend the quantitative
      Wigner&ndash;Araki&ndash;Yanase theorem&mdash;a universal restriction on measurement implementation under a
      conservation law&mdash;to error and disturbance of arbitrary definitions and processes. Third, we give a novel
      treatment of out-of-time-orderd-correlator (OTOC)&mdash;a measure of quantum chaos in a quantum many-body
      system&mdash;as irreversibility in analogy with the measurement context, and its experimental evaluation method.

      <h4>Minimal Equational Theories for Quantum Circuits</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We introduce the first minimal and complete equational theory for quantum circuits. Hence, we show that any true
      equation on quantum circuits can be derived from simple rules, all of them being standard except a novel but
      intuitive one which states that a multi-control 2&pi; rotation is nothing but the identity. Our work improves on
      the recent complete equational theories for quantum circuits, by getting rid of several rules including a fairly
      unpractical one. One of our main contributions is to prove the minimality of the equational theory, i.e. none of
      the rules can be derived from the other ones. More generally, we demonstrate that any complete equational theory
      on quantum circuits (when all gates are unitary) requires rules acting on an unbounded number of qubits.
      Finally, we also simplify the complete equational theories for quantum circuits with ancillary qubits and/or
      qubit discarding.

      <h4>On the Hardness of Analyzing Quantum Programs Quantitatively</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We study quantitative properties of quantum programs such as (positive) almost-sure termination, expected
      runtime or expected cost, that is, for example, the expected number of applications of a given quantum gate,
      etc.<br>

      After studying the completeness of these problems in the arithmetical hierarchy over the Clifford+T fragment of
      quantum mechanics, we express these problems using a variation of a quantum pre-expectation transformer, a
      weakest pre-condition based technique that allows to symbolically compute these quantitative properties. Under a
      smooth restriction&mdash;a restriction to polynomials of bounded degree over a real closed field&mdash;we show
      that the quantitative problem, which consists in finding an upper-bound to the pre-expectation, can be decided
      in time double-exponential in the size of a program. Finally, we sketch how the latter can be transformed into
      an efficient synthesis method.

      <h4>Characterising semi-Clifford gates using algebraic sets</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Motivated by their central role in fault-tolerant quantum computation, we study the sets of gates of the
      third-level of the Clifford hierarchy and their distinguished subsets of 'nearly diagonal' semi-Clifford gates.
      The Clifford hierarchy gates can be implemented via gate teleportation given appropriate magic states. The vast
      quantity of these resources states required for achieving fault-tolerance is a significant bottleneck for
      experimental implementations of universal quantum computers. Semi-Clifford gates are important because they can
      be implemented with far more efficient use of these resource states. <br>

      We prove that every third-level gate of up to two qudits is semi-Clifford. We thus generalise results of
      Zeng-Chen-Chuang (2008) in the qubit case and of the second author (2020) in the qutrit case to the case of
      qudits of arbitrary prime dimension d.<br>

      Earlier results relied on exhaustive computations whereas our present work leverages tools of algebraic geometry
      which can be applied more widely within quantum information. Specifically, we construct two schemes
      corresponding to the sets of third-level Clifford hierarchy gates and third-level semi-Clifford gates. We then
      show that the two algebraic sets resulting from reducing these schemes modulo d share the same set of rational
      points.

      <h4>Alternative robust ways of witnessing nonclassicality in the simplest scenario</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      In this work we relate notions of nonclassicality in what is known as the simplest nontrivial scenario (a
      prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two binary-outcome tomographically complete
      measurements). Specifically, we relate the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to
      witness a violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments where the operational
      equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with a novel approach based on the notion of bounded
      ontological distinctness for preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our
      approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular preparations that are relevant in certain
      information processing tasks in that they are associated with the even and odd parity of the bits to
      communicate. When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk of parity
      preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which violating parity preservation (and so
      bounded ontological distinctness) agrees with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in
      the simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation of parity preservation to the
      quantification of contextuality in terms of inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian,
      arXiv:2003.05984(2020)], that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in witnessing
      contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an application of our findings, we treat the case of
      2-bit parity oblivious multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, given that we have a noise
      threshold below which preparation contextuality holds, we use it to establish a condition for which preparation
      contextuality is present in the case where the probability of success exceeds that achieved by any classical
      strategy.

      <h4>All graph state verification protocols are composably secure</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Graph state verification protocols allow multiple parties to share a graph state while checking that the state
      is honestly prepared, even in the presence of malicious parties. Since graph states are the starting point of
      numerous quantum protocols, it is crucial to ensure that graph state verification protocols can safely be
      composed with other protocols, this property being known as composable security. Previous works conjectured that
      such a property could not be proven within the abstract cryptography framework: we disprove this conjecture by
      showing that all graph state verification protocols can be turned into a composably secure protocol with respect
      to the natural functionality for graph state preparation. Moreover, we show that any unchanged graph state
      verification protocol can also be considered as composably secure for a slightly different, yet useful,
      functionality. Finally, we show that these two results are optimal, in the sense that any such generic result,
      considering arbitrary black-box protocols, must either modify the protocol or consider a different
      functionality. <br>

      Along the way, we show a protocol to generalize entanglement swapping to arbitrary graph states that might be of
      independent interest. We derive our results using the scalable ZX-calculus formalism, providing one of the first
      application of this formalism to cryptography.

      <h4>A review and analysis of six extended Wigner's friend arguments</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The Wigner's friend thought experiment was intended to illustrate the difficulty one has in describing an agent
      as a quantum system when that agent performs a measurement. While it does pose a challenge to the orthodox
      interpretation of quantum theory, most modern interpretations have no trouble in resolving the difficulty.
      Recently, a number of extensions of Wigner's ideas have been proposed. We provide a gentle introduction to six
      such arguments, modifying the specifics of many of them so that they are as simple and unified as possible. In
      particular, we show that all of the arguments hinge on assumptions about correlations between measurement
      outcomes that are not accessible to any observer, even in principle. We then provide a critical analysis of each
      argument, focusing especially on how well one can motivate the required assumptions regarding these inaccessible
      correlations. Although we argue that some of these assumptions are not entirely well-motivated, all of the
      arguments do shed light on the nature of quantum theory, especially when concerning the description of agents
      and their measurements.

      <h4>Tsirelson bounds for quantum correlations with indefinite causal order</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal inequalities, an analogue of Bell
      inequalities that constrain the correlations observed by a set of parties operating in a definite order. Since
      the introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum violation, analogue to Tsirelson's
      bound, has remained an open problem. Here we provide a general method for bounding the violation of causal
      inequalities by arbitrary quantum processes with indefinite causal order. We prove that the maximum violation is
      generally smaller than the algebraic maximum, and determine a Tsirelson-like bound for the paradigmatic example
      of the Oreshkov-Brukner-Costa causal inequality. Surprisingly, we find that the algebraic maximum of arbitrary
      causal inequalities can be achieved by a new type of processes that allow for information to flow in an
      indefinite direction within the parties' laboratories. In the classification of the possible correlations, these
      processes play a similar role as the no-signalling processes in Bell scenarios.

      quantum advantage. <br>We introduce commutation groups presented by generators and relations, and analyse them

      Heisenberg group. We introduce contextual words as a general form of contextuality witness. We characterise when
      contextual words can arise in commutation groups, and explicitly construct non-contextual value assignments in
      other cases. Generalized Pauli n-groups are commutation groups. Every commutation group has a unitary
      representation as a sub-group of a generalized Pauli n-group.

      <h4>A graphical language for Gaussian quantum processes</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We give a simple, complete graphical language for Gaussian quantum processes. Our graphical language extends
      Menicucci et al.'s graphical calculus for Gaussian pure states with a representation for processes, including
      measurements. We also interpret the LOv-calculus, a graphical language for reasoning about passive
      linear-optical quantum circuits in our language; extending the LOv-calculus with both active squeezing and
      shearing. Constructing our graphical language requires us to formally extend Gaussian quantum mechanics with
      infinitely-squeezed states. We do this by showing that Gaussian quantum processes can always be though of as
      special kinds of relations between the phase spaces of the systems involved. In this setting, infinite squeezing
      is completely natural; therefore, our work provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal
      calculations in the quantum optics literature involving infinite-squeezing. We demonstrate this utility by
      providing a graphical proof of the continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which would not be
      possible if we took the conventional approach of describing infinite squeezing using distributions.

      <h4>Twisted simplicial distributions</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Bell's notion of non-locality and its generalization quantum contextuality are fundamental features of quantum
      theory. In addition to its foundational importance to quantum theory, contextuality is the source of significant
      advantages in quantum computation. Simplicial distributions provide a topological way of capturing this
      non-classical phenomenon. The theory of simplicial distributions combines the earlier sheaf-theoretic and
      cohomological approaches by modeling measurements and their outcomes as simplicial sets &mdash; a combinatorial
      avatar of topological spaces. One novel feature of the theory is that contextuality proofs can be done using
      arguments that rely on topological intuition. In this work, we introduce simplicial distributions which are
      'twisted' by local algebraic constraints &mdash; a notion which has immediate applications to studying naturally
      appearing twisted quantum probabilities. Our framework is based on the theory of principal bundles from
      simplicial homotopy theory. The powerful techniques introduced in this framework provide valuable tools and new
      insights for the vertex enumeration problem of non-signaling polytopes of quantum foundations and simulation
      polytopes with applications for studying quantum advantage. In addition, our approach is well suited to
      categorical construction for developing a resource theory of contextuality.

      <h4>Relating Wigner's Friend Scenarios to Nonclassical Causal Compatibility, Monogamy Relations, and Fine Tuning
      </h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Nonclassical causal modeling was developed in order to explain violations of Bell inequalities while adhering to
      relativistic causal structure and faithfulness &mdash; that is, avoiding fine-tuned causal explanations.
      Recently, a no-go theorem stronger than Bell's theorem has been derived, based on extensions of Wigner's friend
      thought experiment: the Local Friendliness (LF) no-go theorem. Here we show that the LF no-go theorem poses
      formidable challenges for the field of causal modeling, even when nonclassical and/or cyclic causal explanations
      are considered. We first recast the LF inequalities, one of the key elements of the LF no-go theorem, as special
      cases of monogamy relations stemming from a statistical marginal problem; we then further recast LF inequalities
      as causal compatibility inequalities stemming from a nonclassical causal marginal problem, for a causal
      structure implied by well-motivated causal-metaphysical assumptions. We find that the LF inequalities emerge
      from the causal modeling perspective even when allowing the latent causes of observed events to admit
      post-quantum descriptions, such as Generalised Probabilistic Theories (GPT) or even more exotic theories. We
      further prove that no nonclassical causal model can explain violations of LF inequalities without violating the
      No Fine-Tuning principle. Finally, we note that these obstacles cannot be overcome even if one were to appeal to
      cyclic causal models.

      <h4>Maximal intrinsic randomness of a quantum state</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      One of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum theory is its claim that there is 'intrinsic' randomness in
      the physical world. Arising from the quantum phenomenon of superposition, this randomness has no classical
      counterpart. It ensures, for instance, that the outcomes of an unbiased measurement on a pure quantum state
      cannot be predicted by even the most powerful eavesdropper. By contrast, mixed quantum states also possess an
      apparent, classical form of randomness, as the 'actual' state of the system in each round of measurement may be
      unknown to the experimentalist, but known to a nefarious eavesdropper. We ask, then, how much intrinsic
      randomness can be extracted from a quantum state? We solve this problem for three common quantifiers of
      randomness, the conditional min-, von Neumann and max-entropies, and we derive necessary and sufficient
      conditions for the projective measurements that achieve the bound in each case. While all of the bounds can be
      reached by measuring in a basis unbiased to the diagonal basis of the state, we find other, less intuitive
      measurements that achieve them. Interestingly, we find measurements that saturate one of the entropies but not
      the other two, highlighting the inequivalence between these three characterisations of intrinsic randomness.

      <h4>Classifying Causal Structures: Ascertaining when Classical Correlations are Constrained by Inequalities</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The classical causal relations between a set of variables, some observed and some latent, can induce both
      equality constraints (typically conditional independencies) as well as inequality constraints (Instrumental and
      Bell inequalities being prototypical examples) on their compatible distribution over the observed variables.
      Enumerating a causal structure's implied inequality constraints is generally far more difficult than enumerating
      its equalities. Furthermore, only inequality constraints ever admit violation by quantum correlations. For both
      those reasons, it is important to classify causal scenarios into those which impose inequality constraints
      versus those which do not. Here we develop methods for detecting such scenarios by appealing to d-separation,
      e-separation, and incompatible supports. Many (perhaps all?) scenarios with exclusively equality constraints can
      be detected via a condition articulated by Henson, Lal and Pusey (HLP). Considering all scenarios with up to 4
      observed variables, which number in the thousands, we are able to resolve all but three causal scenarios,
      providing evidence that the HLP condition is, in fact, exhaustive.

      <h4>A minimalist approach to operational theories</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We explore the concept of minimalism within the frameworks of operational theories by developing two classes of
      theories: Minimal Operational Probabilistic Theories (MOPTs) and Minimal Strongly causal Operational
      Probabilistic Theories (MSOPTs). These classes of Operational Probabilistic Theories (OPTs) are characterized by
      the fact that the set of allowed operations with non-trivial input and output systems is restricted to the
      minimum possible. We show that these OPTs, even when allowing for conditioning if entanglement is present,
      satisfy the properties of no-information without disturbance, the fact that extracting information from a system
      irreversibly alters its state, and irreversibility, and that they do not admit a broadcasting channel.
      Furthermore, we show that this holds true even when classicality is assumed by explicitly building two theories,
      termed Minimal Classical Theory (MCT), a MOPT, and Minimal Strongly causal Bilocal Classical Theory (MSBCT), a
      MSOPT.<br>

      Our results also imply that simpliciality, strong causality and local discriminability represent a minimal set
      of axioms characterizing Classical Theory.

      <h4>Qualitative equivalence between incompatibility and Bell nonlocality</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Measurements in quantum theory can fail to be jointly measurable. Like entanglement, this incompatibility of
      measurements is necessary but not sufficient for violating Bell inequalities. The (in)compatibility relations
      among a set of measurements can be represented by a joint measurability structure, i.e., a hypergraph whose
      vertices denote measurements and hyperedges denote all and only compatible sets of measurements. Since
      incompatibility is necessary for a Bell violation, the joint measurability structure on each wing of a Bell
      experiment must necessarily be non-trivial, i.e., it must admit a subset of incompatible vertices. Here we show
      that for any non-trivial joint measurability structure with a finite set of vertices, there exists a quantum
      realization with a set of measurements that enables a Bell violation, i.e., given that Alice has access to this
      incompatible set of measurements, there exists a set of measurements for Bob and an entangled state shared
      between them such that they can jointly violate a Bell inequality. Hence, a non-trivial joint measurability
      structure is not only necessary for a Bell violation, but also sufficient. We also provide a partial
      characterization of qubit measurements that are useful for Bell inequality violations in the simplest joint
      measurability structure of interest, i.e., Specker's scenario, which consists of three pairwise compatible but
      triplewise incompatible measurements.

      <h4>Qubit-count optimization using ZX-calculus</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We propose methods for optimizing the number of qubits in a quantum circuit while preserving the number of
      non-Clifford gates. One of our approaches consists in reversing, as much as possible, the gadgetization of
      Hadamard gates, which is a procedure used by some T-count optimizers to circumvent Hadamard gates at the expense
      of additional qubits. We prove the NP-hardness of this problem and we present an algorithm for solving it. We
      also propose a more general approach to optimize the number of qubits by showing how it relates to well-known
      graph-theoretical problems. This approach can be used to optimize the number of qubits for any computational
      model that can natively be depicted in ZX-calculus, such as the Pauli Fusion computational model which can
      represent lattice surgery operations. We also show how this method can be used to optimize the number of qubits
      in a quantum circuit by using the ZX-calculus as an intermediate representation.

      <h4>Combining Quantum and Classical Control</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The two main notions of control in quantum programming languages are often referred to as "quantum" control and
      "classical" control. With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information (potentially resulting
      from a quantum measurement) and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed-state quantum computation. Whereas with
      quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the "control" is based on
      superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated
      separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients
      for achieving this are: (1)syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed-state
      quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of "quantum configuration" from quantum
      lambda calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable
      (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces (for pure computation) and von Neumann algebras (for mixed-state computation
      in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics).

      <h4>A Simple and Efficient Joint Measurement Strategy for Estimating Non-Commuting Fermionic Observables and
	Hamiltonians</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We propose a simple scheme to estimate fermionic observables and Hamiltonians relevant in quantum chemistry and
      correlated fermionic systems. Our approach is based on implementing a joint measurement of a modified (noisy)
      collection of Majorana monomials of degree-2k in an n mode fermionic system, whose outcome statistics can be
      reproduced from the (parent) measurement together with an efficient classical post-processing. To realize our
      measurement we use: (i) a randomization over a set of unitaries that realize products of Majorana fermion
      operators; (ii) a unitary, sampled at random from a constant-size set of suitably chosen fermionic Gaussian
      unitaries; (iii) a measurement of fermionic occupation numbers; (iv) suitable post-processing. For any constant
      k, our scheme can estimate expectation values of all degree-2k Majorana monomials to &epsi; precision using
      <em>O</em>(n<sup>k</sup>log(n)/&epsi;<sup>2</sup>) measurement rounds, matching the performance offered by
      fermionic shadow tomography. Furthermore, we prove that our joint measurement is asymptotically optimal, in the
      sense that no parent POVM exists that reduces the sample complexity by more than a constant factor. In certain
      settings, such as a rectangular lattice of qubits realizing an n mode fermionic system via the Jordan-Wigner
      transformation, our parent measurement for Majorana pairs and quadruples can be implemented in circuit depth
      <em>O</em>(n<sup>1/2</sup>) with <em>O</em>(n<sup>3/2</sup>) two-qubit gates, offering an improvement over
      fermionic and matchgate classical shadows that require depth <em>O</em>(n) and <em>O</em>(n<sup>2</sup>)
      two-qubit gates. We also benchmark our method on molecular Hamiltonians and observe performances comparable to
      those offered by fermionic classical shadows.

      <h4>State Independence of Quantum Contextuality on a Pauli Abelian Partial Group</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Contextuality is a key feature of quantum information that challenges classical intuitions, providing the basis
      for constructing explicit proofs of quantum advantage. Among the definitions of quantum contextuality, Kochen
      and Specker's definition stands out for its state-independent nature, making it particularly effective for
      applications to quantum algorithmic scenarios. However, it is questionable if Kochen-Specker contextuality
      indeed implies sheaf-theoretic contextuality, which captures contextuality in a more general sense. Furthermore,
      it induces another natural question about the condition where the two definitions become equivalent. In this
      talk, we first review a state-independent all-versus-nothing(AvN) argument and an abelian partial group. Then,
      we establish the equivalence between Kochen-Specker contextuality and state-independent AvN on an abelian
      partial group. This equivalence extends to an arbitrary set of measurements through the concept of partial
      closure. The partial closure formalism is what we have conjectured as a bridge between sheaf-theoretic
      contextuality and Kochen-Specker contextuality, making those two definitions equivalent. We present a proof of
      this conjecture on a Pauli abelian partial group and discuss its generalisability to an arbitrary abelian
      partial group. Overall, an abelian partial group structure can provide a basis for state-independent analysis of
      quantum contextuality. This state-independent framework will pave the way for a shortcut to applications of
      contextuality and an intuition into the fundamental attributes of quantum mechanics.

      <h4>From linear logic to quantum control</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      This talk explores several recent papers by the authors in the quest for a quantum logic founded on the
      Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence. We stand in the quantum control paradigm, where the control flow of programs
      can follow a quantum particle. Our starting point is intuitionistic multiplicative additive linear logic (IMALL)
      with an extended proof language, the <em>L</em><sup><em>S</em></sup>-calculus, allowing to represent matrices,
      vectors, and measurement-free quantum programs. We then introduce a new logical connective, sup, to express
      superposition and measurement. Finally, we model this non-deterministic proof-language for IMALL in the category
      of semimodules over a semiring.

      <h4>Spin-bounded correlations: rotation boxes within and beyond quantum theory</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      How can detector click probabilities respond to spatial rotations around a fixed axis, in any possible physical
      theory? Here, we give a thorough mathematical analysis of this question in terms of "rotation boxes", which are
      analogous to the well-known notion of non-local boxes. We prove that quantum theory admits the most general
      rotational correlations for spins 0, 1/2, and 1, but we describe a metrological game where beyond-quantum
      resources of spin 3/2 outperform all quantum resources of the same spin. We prove a multitude of fundamental
      results about these correlations, including an exact convex characterization of the spin-1 correlations, a
      Tsirelson-type inequality for spins 3/2 and higher, and a proof that the general spin-J correlations provide an
      efficient outer SDP approximation to the quantum set. Furthermore, we review and consolidate earlier results
      that hint at a wealth of applications of this formalism: a theory-agnostic semi-device-independent randomness
      generator, an exact characterization of the quantum (2,2,2)-Bell correlations in terms of local symmetries, and
      the derivation of multipartite Bell witnesses. Our results illuminate the foundational question of how space
      constrains the structure of quantum theory, they build a bridge between semi-device-independent quantum
      information and spacetime physics, and they demonstrate interesting relations to topics such as entanglement
      witnesses, spectrahedra, and orbitopes.

      <h4>Resource-Theoretic Hierarchy of Contextuality for General Probabilistic Theories</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In this work we present a hierarchy of generalized contextuality. It refines the traditional binary distinction between contextual and noncontextual theories, and facilitates their comparison based on how contextual they are. Our approach focuses on the contextuality of prepare-and-measure scenarios, described by general probabilistic theories (GPTs). To motivate the hierarchy, we define it as the resource ordering of a novel resource theory of GPT-contextuality. The building blocks of its free operations are classical systems and GPT-embeddings. The latter are simulations of one GPT by another, which preserve the operational equivalences and thus cannot generate contextuality. Noncontextual theories can be recovered as least elements in the hierarchy. We then define a new contextuality monotone, called classical excess, given by the minimal error of embedding a GPT within an infinite classical system. In addition, we show that the optimal success probability in the parity oblivious multiplexing game also defines a monotone in our resource theory. We end with a discussion of a potential interpretation of the non-free operations of the resource theory of GPT-contextuality as expressing a kind of information erasure.

      <h4>Completeness of qufinite ZXW calculus, a graphical language for finite-dimensional quantum theory</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Finite-dimensional quantum theory serves as the theoretical foundation for quantum information and computation.
      Mathematically, it is formalized in the category FHilb, comprising all finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and
      linear maps between them. However, there has not been a graphical language for FHilb which is both universal and
      complete and thus incorporates a set of rules rich enough to derive any equality of the underlying formalism
      solely by rewriting. In this paper, we introduce the qufinite ZXW calculus - a graphical language for reasoning
      about finite-dimensional quantum theory. We set up a unique normal form to represent an arbitrary tensor and
      prove the completeness of this calculus by demonstrating that any qufinite ZXW diagram can be rewritten into its
      normal form. This result implies the equivalence of the qufinite ZXW calculus and the category FHilb, leading to
      a purely diagrammatic framework for finite-dimensional quantum theory with the same reasoning power. In
      addition, we identify several domains where the application of the qufinite ZXW calculus holds promise. These
      domains include spin networks, interacting mixed-dimensional systems in quantum chemistry, quantum programming,
      high-level description of quantum algorithms, and mixed-dimensional quantum computing. Our work paves the way
      for a comprehensive diagrammatic description of quantum physics, opening the doors of this area to the wider
      public.

      <h4>Bell Nonlocality from Wigner Negativity in Qudit Stabilizer States</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Nonlocality is an essential concept that distinguishes quantum from classical models and has been extensively
      studied in systems of qubits. <br>

      For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with
      stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. <br>

      However, similar to systems with infinite dimension, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit
      systems. <br>

      We propose a family of Bell inequalities that inquire correlations related to the Wigner negativity of
      stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit &pi;/8 gate, which, in the bipartite
      case, is an abstraction of the CHSH inequality. <br>

      The classical bound is simple to compute, and a specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality
      among all qudit states based on the Wigner negativity and the inequality between the square and the maximum
      norm. <br>

      Moreover, the Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume
      of Wigner negativity. <br>

      Additionally, we demonstrate deterministic violations and violations with a constant number of measurements for
      the Bell state, relying on operators innate to higher-dimensional systems than the qudit at hand.

      <h4>Quantum Circuit Optimization with AlphaTensor</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A key challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers is circuit optimization. Focusing on the most
      expensive gates in fault-tolerant quantum computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count
      optimization, i.e., minimizing the number of T gates that are needed to implement a given circuit. To achieve
      this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the
      relationship between optimizing T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods for T-count
      optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about quantum computation and
      leverage gadgets, which significantly reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum
      outperforms the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks (even when compared
      without making use of gadgets). Remarkably, it discovers an efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method for
      multiplication in finite fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best human-designed solutions for relevant
      arithmetic computations used in Shor's algorithm and for quantum chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating it can
      save hundreds of hours of research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way.

      We develop an approach to combining contextuality with causality, which is general enough to cover causal
      background structure, adaptive measurement-based quantum computation, and causal networks. The key idea is to
      view contextuality as arising from a game played between Experimenter and Nature, allowing for causal
      dependencies in the actions of both the Experimenter (choice of measurements) and Nature (choice of outcomes).

      <h4>A Profunctorial Semantics for Quantum Supermaps</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We identify morphisms of strong profunctors as a categorification of quantum supermaps. These black-box
      generalisations of diagrams-with-holes are hence placed within the broader field of profunctor optics, as
      morphisms in the category of copresheaves on concrete networks. This enables the first construction of abstract
      logical connectives such as tensor products and negations for supermaps in a totally theory-independent setting.
      These logical connectives are found to be all that is needed to abstractly model the key structural features of
      the quantum theory of supermaps: black-box indefinite causal order, black-box definite causal order, and the
      factorisation of definitely causally ordered supermaps into concrete circuit diagrams. We demonstrate that at
      the heart of these factorisation theorems lies the Yoneda lemma and the notion of representability.

      <h4>VyZX: Formal Verification of a Graphical Quantum Language with automated structural rewrites</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      ZX-diagrams are typically represented as adjacency-based graphs, reflecting the guiding principle that “only
      connectivity matters”. In the context of formal theorem provers like Coq, however, such graphs are difficult to
      reason about, especially when we seek to give them semantics. To address this gap, we build VyZX, a verified
      library for reasoning about the ZX-calculus, using inductive constructs that arise naturally from category
      theoretic definitions. One of the issues arising from this representation is that we explicitly encode
      associativity information that can be an obstacle to reasoning about connectivity. To address this, we present
      DC⇕AC, a solver to automatically reason about associativity structures built on top of the e-graph solver egg.
      egg performs equivalence saturation with all possible structural rewrites in an efficient manner. We incorporate
      egg into VyZX to allow easy rewriting with the rules of the ZX-calculus.

      <h4>Mapping temporal correlations to contextuality correlations</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We study temporal correlations in a simple setup using a sheaf-theoretic framework in the spirit of Abramsky and
      Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic approach to contextuality; the setup consists of a system and a set of
      measurement sequences which are performed in turn on the system, thereby producing outcomes with a particular
      probability. Nonclassicality then coincides with obstructions to the existence of a global section&mdash;or of a
      global strategy, as we will prefer to call them&mdash;as in the case of contextuality. We limit the amount of
      information that can be signalled; in particular, when a deterministic system is measured the outcome can only
      depend upon a subset of previous measurement choices (which for Bell scenarios becomes previous measurement
      settings). This can be thought of as a restricted type of memory, and we show that in the case that no
      measurements are stored we recover the macrorealistic correlations which were advocated, for example, by Leggett
      and Garg, and that when all measurements are stored this corresponds to a system with maximal memory, and obtain
      the setup studied by Gogioso and Pinzani. We then show that for each signalling depth, there exists a map from
      the temporal setup to a contextuality setup, such that every set of nonclassical temporal correlations on the
      former corresponds to a set of contextual correlations on the latter. Doing so allows us to utilise a result
      from Vorob'ev, originating in the realm of game theory, in order to say, for any temporal setup, whether
      nonclassical correlations can arise. We demonstrate that this Vorob'ev-type result can be extended to the case
      in which outcomes as well as measurements can be stored in memory.

      <h4>A Complete Graphical Language for Linear Optical Circuits with Finite-Photon-Number Sources and Detectors</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Linear optical circuits can be used to manipulate the quantum states of photons as they pass through components
      including beam splitters and phase shifters. Those photonic states possess a particularly high level of
      expressiveness, as they reside within the bosonic Fock space, an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. However,
      these basic components may not be sufficient to efficiently perform all computations of interest, such as
      universal quantum computation. To address this limitation it is common to add auxiliary sources and detectors,
      which enable projections onto auxiliary photonic states and thus increase the versatility of the processes. In
      this paper, we introduce the LOfi-calculus, a graphical language to reason on the infinite-dimensional bosonic
      Fock space with circuits composed of four core elements of linear optics: the phase shifter, the beam splitter,
      and auxiliary sources and detectors with bounded photon number. We present an equational theory that we prove to
      be complete: two LOfi-circuits represent the same quantum process if and only if one can be transformed into the
      other with the rules of the LOfi-calculus. We give a unique and compact universal form for such circuits.

      <h4>Unifying flavors of fault tolerance with the ZX calculus</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      There are several models of quantum computation which exhibit shared fundamental fault-tolerance properties.
      This article makes commonalities explicit by presenting these different models in a unifying framework based on
      the ZX calculus. We focus on models of topological fault tolerance &mdash; specifically surface codes &mdash;
      including circuit-based, measurement-based and fusion-based quantum computation, as well as the recently
      introduced model of Floquet codes. We find that all of these models can be viewed as different flavors of the
      same underlying stabilizer fault-tolerance structure, and sustain this through a set of local equivalence
      transformations which allow mapping between flavors. We anticipate that this unifying perspective will pave the
      way to transferring progress among the different views of stabilizer fault-tolerance and help researchers
      familiar with one model easily understand others.

      <h4>First Steps in Quantum Finite Model Theory</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Spoiler-Duplicator games such as the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé and pebble games are of central importance in finite
      model theory. In this work we study a quantum variant of these game. Our approach is guided by the recent
      categorical characterisation of the games in terms of comonads on the category of relational structures. We show
      that it is possible to define a distributive law of game comonads over the quantum monad, whose Kleisli
      morphisms correspond to perfect winning strategies in the non-local structure homomorphism game. In order to
      prove this result we must introduce and work with a generalisation of relational structures, which we dub
      commeasurable structures. The existence of a distributive law provides a positive answer to an open question of
      Abramsky et al. and allows us to define a biKleisli category, whose morphisms we characterise as winning
      strategies for Duplicator in a quantum version of the existential positive versions of the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé
      and pebble games. We also introduce a notion of quantum satisfiability for first-order logic formulas and extend
      the well-known correspondence between spoiler-duplicator games and fragments of first-order logic to a quantum
      setting.

      <h4>Causal influence versus signalling for interacting quantum channels</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A causal relation between quantum agents, say Alice and Bob, is necessarily mediated by an interaction.
      Modelling the last one as a reversible quantum channel, an intervention of Alice can have causal influence on
      Bob's system, modifying correlations between Alice and Bob's systems. Causal influence between quantum systems
      necessarily allows for signalling. Here we prove a mismatch between causal influence and signalling via direct
      computation of the two quantities for the Cnot gate. Finally we show a continuity theorem for causal effects of
      unitary channels: a channel has small causal influence iff it allows for small signalling.

      <h4>From dual-unitary to biunitary: a 2-categorical model for exactly-solvable many-body quantum dynamics</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Dual-unitary brickwork circuits are an exactly-solvable model for many-body chaotic quantum systems, based on
      2-site gates which are unitary in both the time and space directions. Prosen has recently described an
      alternative model called 'dual-unitary interactions round-a-face', which we here call 'clockwork', based on
      2-controlled 1-site unitaries composed in a non-brickwork structure, yet with many of the same attractive global
      properties. We present a 2-categorical framework that simultaneously generalizes these two existing models, and
      use it to show that brickwork and clockwork circuits can interact richly, yielding new types of generalized
      heterogeneous circuits. We show that these interactions are governed by quantum combinatorial data, which we
      precisely characterize. These generalized circuits remain exactly-solvable and we show that they retain the
      attractive features of the original models such as single-site correlation functions vanishing everywhere except
      on the causal light-cone. Our presented framework allows us to directly extend the notion of solvable initial
      states to these biunitary circuits, which are shown to result in maximal entanglement growth and exact
      thermalization after finitely many time steps under biunitary circuit dynamics.

      <h4>Quantum Circuits surpass Biased Threshold Circuits in Constant-Depth</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Shallow-depth quantum circuits with gates of bounded fan-in have been demonstrated to achieve computational
      advantages over shallow-depth classical circuits, even allowing for unbounded fan-in (AC<sup>0</sup>). Despite
      their versatility, these computational models are known to be less powerful than Polynomial Threshold Function
      (PTF) circuits, which serve as a natural model for neural networks and exhibit enhanced expressivity and
      computational capabilities. We prove that PTF circuits with a constant number of layers, when biased (having the
      activation region of their gates limited), fail to solve certain computational (relational) problems that
      quantum circuits of constant depth can solve. Furthermore, we prove such a separation for a family of problems,
      one for each prime qudit dimension. We prove all of these separations via correlation bounds for average-case
      hardness. We also establish a tight lower bound on the size of biased PTF circuits that can solve a specific
      relational problem <em>exactly</em>. This allows us to significantly reduce the estimated resource requirements
      for potential demonstrations of quantum advantage. <br>

      The main challenges in this area of research arise in establishing the classical lower bounds, and in designing
      non-local games with quantum-classical gaps in the winning strategy in order to go beyond qubits to higher
      dimensions. To address the former, we have formulated novel switching lemmas specifically designed for
      multi-output biased PTF circuits, and have developed a way to assess the difficulty of deriving exact solutions.
      Our contribution towards the latter is grounded in a novel assortment of non-local games, characterized by an
      exponential difference between their classical and quantum success probabilities. Finally, our technical
      developments could be of more general and independent interest.

      <h4>Quantum Influences and Event Relativity</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We develop an approach to decoherence that is entirely based on quantum causal structures, and not on quantum
      states. We show that, relative to subsets of unitarily interacting subsystems, unique classical structures
      emerge from causal decoherence. This allows us to propose a precise and realistic interpretation of quantum
      theory as a description of relational events and their emergence from causal structure. The interpretation
      recovers the statistics from standard quantum theory, while providing clear resolutions to various quantum
      paradoxes. Our framework brings together ideas from quantum causal models, relational quantum mechanics, and
      consistent histories. <br>

      <h4>Universal algorithm for transforming Hamiltonian eigenvalues</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Manipulating Hamiltonians governing physical systems has found a broad range of applications, from quantum
      chemistry to semiconductor design. In this work, we provide a new way of manipulating Hamiltonians, by
      transforming their eigenvalues while keeping their eigenstates unchanged. We develop a universal algorithm that
      deterministically implements any desired (suitably differentiable) function on the eigenvalues of any unknown
      Hamiltonian, whose positive-time and negative-time dynamics are given as a black box. Our algorithm uses
      correlated randomness to efficiently combine two subroutines&mdash;namely controlization and Fourier series
      simulation&mdash;exemplifying a general compilation procedure that we develop. The time complexity of our
      algorithm is significantly reduced using compilation compared to a naive concatenation of the subroutines and
      outperforms similar methods based on the quantum singular value transformation. Finally, to circumvent the need
      for the negative-time dynamics, we present a universal algorithm to transform positive-time to negative-time
      dynamics without adding an auxiliary qubit, which could also be of standalone interest.

      <h4>Theory-Independent Realism</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The distinctive features of quantum mechanics, which set it apart from other physical theories, challenge our
      notions of realism. Recovering realism from purely philosophical grounds, a quantitative and operational
      criterion was proposed in the past, but solely for the context of quantum mechanics. We use a framework of
      generalized probabilistic theories to expand the notion of realism for a theory-independent context, providing a
      criterion uniquely based on the probabilities assigned to measurement outcomes. More so, using robustness and
      the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we propose quantifiers for the realism of arbitrary physical properties given a
      particular state of a generic physical theory. These theory-independent quantifiers are then employed in quantum
      mechanics and we investigate their relation with another well-established irrealism measure.

      In this talk, we introduce a notion of local fraction for experiments taking place against arbitrary static
      causal backgrounds&mdash;greatly generalising previous results on no-signalling scenarios&mdash;and we
      explicitly formulate a linear program to compute this quantity. We derive a free characterisation of causal
      functions which allows us to efficiently construct the matrices required to perform concrete calculations. We
      demonstrate our techniques by analysing the local fraction of a novel example involving two Bell tests in
      interleaved causal order.

      <h4>Information-theoretic derivation of energy and speed bounds</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Information-theoretic insights have proven fruitful in many areas of quantum physics. But can the fundamental
      dynamics of quantum systems be derived from purely information-theoretic principles, without resorting to
      Hilbert space structures such as unitary evolution and self-adjoint observables? Here we provide a model where
      the dynamics originates from a condition of informational non-equilibrium, the deviation of the system's state
      from a reference state associated to a field of identically prepared systems. Combining this idea with three
      basic information-theoretic principles, we derive a notion of energy that captures the main features of energy
      in quantum theory: it is observable, bounded from below, invariant under time-evolution, in one-to-one
      correspondence with the generator of the dynamics, and quantitatively related to the speed of state changes. Our
      results provide an information-theoretic reconstruction of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum
      evolutions, thus establishing a bridge between dynamical and information-theoretic notions.

      <h4>Contextuality of Cloning via Dimensional Witnesses</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The no-cloning theorem, a fundamental principle in quantum information processing and cryptography, states that
      an unknown quantum state cannot be exactly and deterministically cloned. Due to the lack of such limitation for
      copying classical bits, no-cloning is often considered a genuinely nonclassical property of quantum mechanics.
      While perfect quantum cloning is impossible, certain quantum cloning machines can produce approximate copies
      with bounded fidelities. On the other hand, generalized contextuality is also known to be a bona fide quantum
      features. In this work, we address the relationship between approximate cloning and contextuality, demonstrating
      that all main classes of approximate cloning do not admit a noncontextual ontological model.

      <h4>Fusion and flow: formal protocols to reliably build photonic graph states</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Photonics has been the platform of reference for implementations of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC),
      with recently proposed fusion-based architectures promising to achieve fault-tolerance. In these approaches,
      graph states are constructed by performing probabilistic entangling measurements on a supply of small resource
      states. Modeling the different levels in this architecture requires the interplay of linear algebraic,
      stochastic, and control flow structures, that have yet to be put together into a unified formal language to
      verify and simulate optical protocols that implement fusion-based computations. This paper develops a framework
      for reasoning about different levels of photonic quantum computing by bringing together linear optics, MBQC, and
      dataflow programming. We start by defining a graphical language combining linear optical circuits and the ZX
      calculus to reason about dual-rail qubits. We use it to fully characterize the kinds of fusion measurements
      which induce Pauli errors and are thus correctable using flow structure on a target MBQC graph. We then define a
      dataflow programming language for optical protocols that construct photonic cluster states. Protocols can be
      efficiently verified by graphical rewriting and recursive reasoning. We use the language to prove the
      correctness of new repeat-until-success protocols for the realization of arbitrary fusions. We present an
      entirely graphical proof that linear optics, entangled photon sources, active switching, and classical
      feed-forward suffice to build arbitrary MBQC patterns and hence achieve universal quantum computation. Our
      results pave the way for developing verified compilation algorithms for photonic quantum computing.

      <h4>A theory of Inaccessible Information</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Out of the many lessons quantum mechanics seems to teach us, one is that it seems there are things we cannot
      experimentally have access to. There is, indeed, a fundamental limit to our ability to experimentally explore
      the world. In this work we accept this lesson as a fact and we build a general theory based on this principle.
      We start by assuming the existence of statements whose truth value is not experimentally accessible. That is,
      there is no way, not even in theory, to directly test if these statements are true or false. We further develop
      a theory in which experimentally accessible statements are a union of a fixed minimum number of inaccessible
      statements. For example, the value of truth of the statements A and B is not accessible, but the value of truth
      of the statement “A or B" is accessible. We do not directly assume probability theory, we exclusively define
      experimentally accessible and inaccessible statements and build on these notions using the rules of classical
      logic. We find that an interesting structure emerges. Developing this theory, we relax the logical structure,
      naturally obtaining a derivation of a constrained quasi-probabilistic theory rich in structure that we name
      theory of inaccessible information. Surprisingly, the simplest model of theory of inaccessible information is
      the qubit in quantum mechanics. Along the path for the construction of this theory, we characterise and study a
      family of multiplicative information measures that we call inaccessibility measures.

      <h4>Catalysing Completeness and Universality</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A catalysis state is a quantum state that is used to make some desired operation possible or more efficient,
      while not being consumed in the process. Recent years have seen catalysis used in state-of-the-art protocols for
      implementing magic state distillation or small angle phase rotations. In this paper we will see that we can also
      use catalysis to prove that certain gate sets are computationally universal, and that we can use them to extend
      completeness results of graphical languages to larger fragments. In particular, we give a simple proof of the
      computational universality of the CS+Hadamard gate set using the catalysis of a T gate using a CS gate, which
      sidesteps the more complicated analytic arguments of the original proof by Kitaev. This then also gives us a
      simple self-contained proof of the computational universality of Toffoli+Hadamard. Additionally, We show that
      the phase-free ZH-calculus can be extended to a larger complete fragment, just by using a single catalysis rule
      (and one scalar rule).

      <h4>A noncontextual ontological model for bilocal classical theory</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      In this paper we construct a generalised noncontextual ontological model for the theory known as bilocal
      classical theory. From the point of view of research into generalised noncontextuality, this is interesting as
      it is, to our knowledge, only the second time that such a model has been constructed for an entire theory of
      physics, as opposed to just some simple scenario within the theory. Moreover, it is the first time that such a
      model has been constructed for a theory which fails to be locally tomographic. In particular, this shows that
      the assumption of local tomography underpinning the structure theorem in [1] is a genuine limitation of the
      theorem. From the point of view of research into generalised probabilistic theories and bilocal clasical theory
      in particular, this result is interesting in that it refutes the conjecture of [2] which states that there is no
      local-realist ontological model for the theory. Moreover, the ontological model underpinning bilocal classical
      theory is in many ways much simpler to work with than the original formulation of the theory, which, in
      particular, opens the door to generalisations to applying this idea to other generalised probabilistic theories.

      <h4>Compounding and Coarse-Graining as Monads</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Two very basic constructions involving general probabilistic models are the formation of coarse-grained versions
      of experiments, and the formation of branching sequential experiments. The latter allows for the conditioning of
      states on the results of previous measurements. When one condition on the results of different coarse-grainings
      of the same previous experiment, the possibility of interference effects arises. Here, I show how to formulate
      both constructions in terms of monads on a suitable category of (general) probabilistic models. Moreover, I show
      that these are connected by a distributive law, allowing for a composite monad describing the closure of a
      probabilistic model under both coarse-graining and sequential measurement. Algebras for these monad are
      discussed, some lessons are drawn regarding the formation of sequential products of effects, and some questions
      for further research are adduced.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      This is the second in a series of "graphical grokking" papers in which we study how stabiliser codes can be understood using the ZX-calculus. In this paper we show that certain complex rules involving ZX-diagrams, called spider nest identities, can be captured succinctly using the scalable ZX-calculus, and all such identities can be proved inductively from a single new rule using the Clifford ZX-calculus. This can be combined with the ZX picture of CSS codes, developed in the first "grokking" paper, to give a simple characterisation of the set of all transversal diagonal gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy implementable in an arbitrary CSS code.

      <h4>A Sound and Complete Equational Theory for 3-qubit Toffoli-Hadamard Circuits</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We give a sound and complete equational theory for 3-qubit quantum circuits over the Toffoli-Hadamard gate set { X,
      CX, CCX, H }. That is, we introduce a collection of true equations among Toffoli-Hadamard circuits on three qubits
      that is sufficient to derive any other true equation between such circuits. To obtain this equational theory, we first
      consider circuits over the Toffoli-K gate set { X, CX, CCX, K }, where K = HxH. The Toffoli-Hadamard and Toffoli-K
      gate sets appear similar, but they are crucially different on exactly three qubits. Indeed, in this case, the former
      generates an infinite group of operators, while the latter generates the finite group of automorphisms of the
      well-known E8 lattice. We take advantage of this fact, and of the theory of automorphism groups of lattices, to obtain
      a sound and complete collection of equations for Toffoli-K circuits. We then extend this equational theory to one for
      Toffoli-Hadamard circuits by leveraging prior work of Li et al. on Toffoli-Hadamard operators.

      <h4>Pauli flow on open graphs with unknown measurement labels</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      One-way quantum computation, or measurement-based quantum computation, is a universal model of quantum computation
      alternative to the circuit model. The computation progresses by measurements of a pre-prepared resource state together
      with corrections of undesired outcomes via applications of Pauli gates to yet unmeasured qubits. The fundamental
      question of this model is determining whether computation can be implemented deterministically. Pauli flow is one of
      the most general structures guaranteeing determinism. It is also essential for polynomial time ancilla-free circuit
      extraction. It is known how to efficiently determine the existence of Pauli flow given an open graph together with a
      measurement labelling (a choice of measurements to be performed).
      <br>

      In this work, we focus on the problem of deciding the existence of Pauli flow for a given open graph when the
      measurement labelling is unknown. We show that this problem is in RP by providing a random polynomial time algorithm.
      To do it, we extend previous algebraic interpretations of Pauli flow, by showing that, in the case of X and Z
      measurements only, flow existence corresponds to the right-invertibility of a matrix derived from the adjacency
      matrix. We also use this interpretation to show that the number of output qubits can always be reduced to match the
      number of input qubits while preserving the existence of flow.

      <h4>Exact Synthesis of Multiqutrit Clifford-cyclotomic Circuits</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      It is known that the matrices that can be exactly represented by a multiqubit circuit over the Toffoli+Hadamard, Clifford+T , or, more generally, Clifford-cyclotomic gate set are precisely the unitary matrices with entries in the ring Z[1/2, &zeta;<sub>k</sub>], where k is a positive integer that depends on the gate set and &zeta;<sub>k</sub> is a primitive 2<sup>k</sup>-th root of unity. In the present paper, we establish an analogous correspondence for qutrits. We define the multiqutrit Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of degree 3<sup>k</sup> by extending the classical qutrit gates X, CX, and CCX with the Hadamard gate H and the Tk gate Tk = diag(1, &omega;<sub>k</sub>, &omega;<sub>k</sub><sup>2</sup>), where &omega;<sub>k</sub> is a primitive 3<sup>k</sup>-th root of unity. This gate set is equivalent to the qutrit Toffoli+Hadamard gate set when k=1, and to the qutrit Clifford+Tk gate set when k &gt; 1. We then prove that a 3<sup>n</sup>&times;3<sup>n</sup> unitary matrix U can be represented by an n-qutrit circuit over the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of degree 3<sup>k</sup> if and only if the entries of U lie in the ring Z[1/3, &omega;<sub>k</sub>].

      <h4>The Qudit ZH Calculus for Arbitrary Finite Fields: Universality and Application</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We propose a generalization of the graphical ZH calculus to qudits of prime-power dimensions q = p<sup>t</sup>,
      implementing field arithmetic in arbitrary finite fields. This is an extension of a previous result by Roy
      et.al. which implemented arithmetic of prime-sized fields; and an alternative to a result by de Beaudrop which
      extended the ZH to implement cyclic-ring arithmetic in &Zopf; / q&Zopf; rather than field arithmetic in
      &Fopf;<sub>q</sub>. We show this generalized ZH calculus to be universal over matrices &Copf;<sup>qn</sup>
      &rightarrow; &Copf;<sup>qm</sup> with entries in the ring &Zopf;[&omega;] where &omega, is a <em>p</em>th (not
      <em>q</em>th!) root of unity. As an illustration of the necessity of such an extension of ZH for field rather
      than cyclic-ring arithmetic, we offer a graphical description and proof for a quantum algorithm for polynomial
      interpolation. This algorithm relies on the invertibility of multiplication in non-prime-sized fields, and
      therefore can only be described in a graphical language that implements field, rather than ring, multiplication.

      <h4>Procedurally Optimised ZX-Diagram Cutting for Efficient T-Decomposition in Classical Simulation</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A quantum circuit may be strongly classically simulated with the aid of ZX-calculus by decomposing its t T-gates into a sum of 2<sup>&alpha;t</sup> classically computable stabiliser terms. In this paper, we introduce a general procedure to find an optimal pattern of vertex cuts in a ZX-diagram to maximise its T-count reduction at the cost of the fewest cuts. Rather than reducing a Clifford+T diagram based on a fixed routine of decomposing its T-gates directly (as is the conventional approach), we focus instead on taking advantage of certain patterns and structures common to such circuits to, in effect, design by automatic procedure an arrangement of spider decompositions that is optimised for the particular circuit. In short, this works by assigning weights to vertices based on how many T-like gates they are blocking from fusing/cancelling and then appropriately propagating these weights through any neighbours which are then blocking weighted vertices from fusing, and so on. Ultimately, this then provides a set of weightings on relevant nodes, which can then each be cut, starting from the highest weighted down. While this is a heuristic approach, we show that, for circuits small enough to verify, this method achieves the most optimal set of cuts possible 71&percnt; of the time. Furthermore, there is no upper bound for the efficiency achieved by this method, allowing, in principle, an effective decomposition efficiency &alpha;&nbsp;&rightarrow;&nbsp;0 for highly structured circuits. Even applied to random pseudo-structured circuits (produced from CNOTs, phase gates, and Toffolis), we record the number of stabiliser terms required to reduce all T-gates, via our method as compared to that of the more conventional T-decomposition approaches (namely that of Kissinger and van de Wetering, with &alpha;&nbsp;&approx;&nbsp;0.47), and show consistent improvements of orders of magnitude, with an effective efficiency 0.1&nbsp;&lesssim;&nbsp;&alpha;&nbsp;&lesssim;&nbsp;0.2.

      <h4>Effect Semantics for Quantum Process Calculi</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Along with the development of quantum communication protocols, quantum extensions of process calculi have been explored for modelling communicating systems featuring both non-determinism and quantum capabilities. However, recent works have shown that it is surprisingly difficult to define a behavioural equivalence that matches the observational properties prescribed by quantum theory. Moreover, the two proposals explicitly addressing this issue, namely qCCS and lqCCS, do not define an algorithm for deciding equivalence: in order to equate two processes, one has to compare their behaviour under any possible input state. We introduce a new semantic model based on effects, i.e. probabilistic predicates on quantum states that represent their observable properties. We define and investigate the properties of effect distributions and effect labelled transition systems (eLTS), generalizing probability distributions and probabilistic labelled transition systems (pLTS), respectively. We give an eLTS-based semantics for a minimal quantum process calculus, featuring concurrent and non-deterministic behaviour, quantum measurements and unitaries. We give a behavioural equivalence in the form of a bisimilarity relation, and we prove it sound and complete with respect to the purely probabilistic observable behaviour of quantum processes. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first algorithmically verifiable proposal that abides to the properties of quantum theory.

      <h4>Multi-controlled Phase Gate Synthesis with ZX-calculus applied to Neutral Atoms Hardware</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Quantum circuit synthesis describes the process of converting arbitrary unitary operations into a gate sequence of a fixed universal gate set, usually defined by the operations native to a given hardware platform. Most current synthesis algorithms are designed to synthesize towards a set of single qubit rotations and an additional entangling two qubit gate, such as CX, CZ, or the Molmer Sorensen gate. However, with the emergence of neutral atom based hardware and their native support for gates with more than two qubits, synthesis approaches tailored to these new gate sets become necessary. In this work, we present an approach to synthesize multi controlled phase gates using ZX calculus. By representing quantum circuits as graph like ZX diagrams, one can utilize the distinct graph structure of diagonal gates to identify multi controlled phase gates inherently present in some quantum circuits even if none were explicitly defined in the original circuit. We evaluate the approach on a wide range of benchmark circuits and compare them to the standard Qiskit synthesis regarding its circuit execution time for neutral atom based hardware with native support of multi controlled gates. Our results show possible advantages for current state of the art hardware and represent the first exact synthesis algorithm supporting arbitrary sized multi controlled phase gates.

      <h4>Compositional Quantum Algorithms for Text Processing</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Quantum computing and AI have found a fruitful intersection in the field of natural language processing. We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Grover-like speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work.

      <h4>A Graphical #SAT Algorithm for Formulae with Small Clause Density</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We study the counting version of the Boolean satisfiability problem <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span> using the ZH-calculus, a graphical language originally introduced to reason about quantum circuits. Using this, we generalize <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span> to a weighted variant we call <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span><sub>&pm;</sub>, which is complete for the class GapP. We show there is an efficient linear-time reduction from <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#2SAT</span><sub>&pm;</sub>, unlike previous reductions from <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#2SAT</span> which blow up the size of the formula by a polynomial factor. Our main conceptual contribution is that introducing weights to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span> allows for more efficient translations, and we use this to remove the dependence on clause width k in this case. We observe that DPLL-style algorithms for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#2SAT</span> can be adapted to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#2SAT</span><sub>&pm;</sub> directly and hence the best-known upper bounds for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#2SAT</span> apply. Applying an upper bound for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#2SAT</span> in terms of variables gives us upper bounds for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span> in terms of clauses and variables that are better than O<sup>*</sup>(2<sup>n</sup>) for small clause densities of m&frasl;n &lt; 2.25, and improve on previous average-case and worst-case bounds for k &ge; 6 and k &ge; 4, respectively. Applying a similar bound in terms of clauses produces a bound of O<sup>*</sup>(1.1740<sup>L</sup>) in terms of the length of the formula. These are, to our knowledge, the first non-trivial upper bounds for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#SAT</span> that is independent of clause size, and in terms of formula length, respectively. Based on a result of Kutzkov, we find an improved bound on <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">#3SAT</span> for 1.2577 &lt; m&frasl;n &le; 7&frasl;3. Finally, we use this technique to find an upper bound on the complexity of calculating amplitudes of quantum circuits in terms of the total number of gates. Our results demonstrate that graphical reasoning can lead to new algorithmic insights, even outside the domain of quantum computing that the calculus was intended for.

      <h4>Density Matrices for Metaphor Understanding</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      In physics, density matrices are used to represent mixed states, i.e. probabilistic mixtures of pure states. This concept has previously been used to model lexical ambiguity. In this paper, we consider metaphor as a type of lexical ambiguity, and examine whether metaphorical meaning can be effectively modelled using mixtures of word senses. We find that modelling metaphor is significantly more difficult than other kinds of lexical ambiguity, but that our best-performing density matrix method outperforms simple baselines as well as some neural language models.

      <h4>Qubrabench: Quantum Benchmarking without Quantum Computers</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Quantum algorithms promise significant asymptotic speedups compared to their classical counterparts in several
      areas such as search, solving linear systems and factoring.<br>

      However we find ourselves in the NISQ era, and these speedups are only expected in the future in a
      fault-tolerant regime.<br>

      To better understand which algorithms show promising speedups, we are forced to rely on purely theoretical
      analyses.<br>

      These often capture worst-case complexities, and we are unable to gain insights into how these algorithms would
      perform on real-world problem instances and data.<br>

      To remedy this, one does "hybrid benchmarking", an instrumentation methodology of obtaining quantum costs by
      using known formulas for basic primitive routines, while computing the expected output of each step by using a
      state-of-the-art classical implementation.<br>

      So far, this has only been done by hand, on a case-by-case basis for each application.<br>

      We present Qubrabench, a novel python library that supports hybrid benchmarking to estimate expected quantum and
      classical query costs for arbitrary programs that use primitives with quantum counterparts.<br>

      This enables one to use these primitives in their existing code, by replacing the default primitives, and mark
      the oracles and data-structures that they would like to obtain query costs for.<br>

      Qubrabench supports computing query costs for arbitrarily nested quantum subroutines, by internally using well
      known theoretical query composition models.<br>

      This enables users to gain insights into when and where they could expect quantum speedups for their
      state-of-the-art algorithms and heuristics.

      <h4>Fast algorithms for classical specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The stabiliser formalism plays a central role in quantum computing, error correction, and fault-tolerance.
      Stabiliser states are used to encode quantum data. Clifford gates are those which can be easily performed
      fault-tolerantly in the most common error correction schemes. Their mathematical properties are the subject of
      significant research interest. <br>

      Numerical experiments are critical to formulating and testing conjectures involving the stabiliser formalism.
      Conversions between different specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates are also important
      components of classical algorithms for simulating quantum circuits. <br>

      In this work, we develop novel mathematical insights concerning stabiliser states and Clifford gates that
      significantly clarify their descriptions. We then utilise these to provide fast methods for verifying that a
      vector is a stabiliser state, and interconverting between its specification as amplitudes, a quadratic form, and
      a check matrix. These methods are in turn leveraged to rapidly check if a given unitary matrix is a Clifford
      gate and to interconvert between the matrix of a Clifford gate and its compact specification as a stabiliser
      tableau. <br>

      For example, we extract the stabiliser tableau of a Clifford gate matrix with N<sup>2</sup> entries in O(NlogN)
      time.
      Remarkably, it is not necessary to read all the elements of a Clifford matrix to extract its stabiliser tableau.
      This represents a superexponential speedup over the best known methods. <br>

      Our methods outperform the best-known brute force methods by some orders of magnitude with asymptotic
      improvements that are exponential in the number of qubits. We provide example implementations of our algorithms
      in Python.
