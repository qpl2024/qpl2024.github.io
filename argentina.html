	</header>
	<h3>The name Argentina</h3>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">
	    <p style="text-align: justify;">
	    It comes from the Latin term “argentum”, which means
	    "silver". The origin of this name goes back to the first
	    voyages made by the Spanish conquerors to the Río de la
	    Plata. The survivors of the shipwrecked expedition mounted
	    by Juan Díaz de Solís found indigenous people in the region
	    who gave them silver objects as presents. The news about
	    the legendary Sierra del Plata - a mountain rich in silver
	    - reached Spain around 1524. At that point, the Portuguese
	    named the river of Solís, "Río de la Plata" (River of
	    Silver). Two years later the Spanish people started to use
	    same name. In 1853 our National Constitution included the
	    name “República Argentina” (Argentine Republic) among the
	    official names to designate the government and the
	    territory.

	<h3>Location, area and frontiers</h3>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">

	  <div class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">
	    <p style="text-align: justify;">
	    Located in South America, and thus, in the southern hemisphere,
	    Argentina has a continental area of almost 2.8 million square
	    kilometers; approximately 54% are plains (grasslands and
	    savannahs), 23% plateaus, and the other 23% mountains. It is
	    3,800 Km. long and is located between latitude 22o and 55o. Its
	    border with Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Chile has a
	    perimeter of 9,376 Km, while the territory bordered by the
	    Atlantic Ocean is 4,725 Km long.
	    </p>

	<h3>Geography</h3>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">
	    <p style="text-align: justify;">
	    Argentina exhibits an enormous contrast between the immense eastern
	    plains and the impressive Andes mountain range in the west, which
	    is also the border with Chile, and boasts the highest peak in the
	    Western hemisphere: the 6,959 m high Aconcagua.
	    <br>
	    From Jujuy to Tierra del Fuego, the Andes ranges show marvelous
	    contrasts: the Northwest plateaus, the lake region, the forests and
	    glaciers in the Patagonia.
	    <br>
	    In the north, Chaco is a forested area linked to rivers Bermejo,
	    Salado and Pilcomayo.
	    <br>
	    Located between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, the Argentine
	    Mesopotamia (provinces of Entre Ríos, Corrientes and Misiones) is
	    formed by low hills, where pools and marshlands evidence the
	    ancient courses of these great rivers. In some places within the
	    subtropical rain forest, there are fissures which provide
	    spectacular phenomena such as the Iguazú Falls.
	    <br>
	    The Pampas, in the center of Argentina, is the largest and
	    best-known area of plains.  Agricultural and livestock activities
	    are performed in this area, which includes the province of Buenos
	    Aires, the northeast of La Pampa, the south of Córdoba and south of
	    Santa Fe. To the south, the plains give way to small hills in
	    Tandil and de la Ventana, and to the west, to the Córdoba hills.
	    <br>
	    Towards the south, from the Andes to the sea, we find the sterile
	    and stony plateaus of Patagonia, swept by the wind during most of
	    the year. The Atlantic coast, lined with high cliffs, forms massive
	    indentations like the Peninsula Valdés, with its spectacular and
	    unique colonies of sea animals.

	    <p style="text-align: justify;">
	    <a href="https://www.argentina.travel/en">Argentina’s official
	      tourism website</a> contains tons of information about the
	    country and places to visit. Buenos Aires has flights to the main
	    attractions in the country. There are daily flights to Iguazu
	    Falls, Salta, Jujuy, Mendoza, Bariloche, Puerto Madryn, or Ushuaia,
	    as well as other attractive places in countries in the region, such
	    as Santiago, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, etc.

	<h3>Climate</h3>
	<div>
	  <p style="text-align: justify;">
	  The country’s territory offers a wide variety of climates:
	  subtropical in the north, sub- Antarctic in the southern Patagonia,
	  and mild and humid in the Pampas plains. Media temperature from
	  November to March is 23° C, and 12° C from June to September.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<h3>Population</h3>
	<div>
	  <p style="text-align: justify;">
	  Argentina's current population is more than 45 million inhabitants,
	  almost half of which live in the city and the province of Buenos
	  Aires. Population density calculated on a national basis is 16
	  inhabitants per square kilometer.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<h3>Language</h3>
	<div>
	  <p style="text-align: justify;">
	  Spanish is the official language of the Argentine Republic. In Buenos
	  Aires, some "lunfardo" expressions -city slang- are used.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<h3>Electricity</h3>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">
	    <p style="text-align: justify;">
	    Electric power in Argentina is 220 volts, 50-cycle alternating
	    current. Power outlets have 2 cylindrical holes (Type C) or 2 flat
	    holes with a ground connection (Type I). It is convenient to bring
	    an adaptor for these outlets to use your electric devices without
	    problems. Type C is the old standard, and most new buildings have
	    only Type I.<br>
	    <b>Do not mistake Type C with Types E or F (which are
	    used in France, Spain, Italy, etc.), since those are thicker than
	    Type C and will not fit.</b>
	    </p>

	<h3>Sanitary Information</h3>
	<div>
	  <p style="text-align: justify;">
	  Vaccination is neither obligatory nor necessary to visit Buenos Aires
	  since the city is safe from the sanitary viewpoint.  The public water
	  supply is reliable.
	  <br>
	  Public hospitals (available for tourists) offer a 24-hour emergency
	  service, without charge.  Argentine physicians are considered excellent
	  professionals worldwide. The ambulance emergency service (SAME) is also
	  for free.
